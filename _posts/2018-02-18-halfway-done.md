title: Halfway Done!
---

Short post here. I just wanted to mark the occasion that I'm halfway done with my bootcamp! I can't believe it. It's gone by pretty fast. I have learned so much. I just finished up refactoring a project that I originally built with jQuery to now being built in AngularJS. It was such a great exercise. I really enjoyed the refactoring process. Building the same project with two different libraries/frameworks may seem dull to some, but it was a great learning experience. It took some time to overhaul a project into a different framework, especially when learning the framework along the way. But I'm sure this happens all the time in the real world. It was good experience that will definitely help me when I get my first developer job.
