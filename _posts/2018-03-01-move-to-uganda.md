title: Moving to Uganda!!
---

So, I'm moving to Uganda for a couple of years! Pretty crazy, right? My wife works in international development and she earned herself a kick-ass posting in Kampala, their capital. I actually have to quit my job in order to go out there, which is both good and bad. Bad because it's going to be weird not waking up each morning and not have a job to go to. But good because I'm going to have all sorts of time to code. Thank goodness I chose an _online_ bootcamp! I'm sure it's going to take me a while to get settled, but I'm looking forward to this little adventure. Well, I have to go pack, so I'll talk to you later!
