I am a proud second-career dev. The previous eleven-year period saw me in the finance sector. I made the decision to switch careers because I wanted one where I needed to think critically, to never stop learning, and to work with others to create something special. As a full-stack developer, I have all of those things. Being able to build beautiful and responsive web applications has become a great joy of my life. I love building with **JavaScript (React, AngularJS), HTML, CSS, Node.js, MongoDB, and Ruby.**

I grew up a little south of Pittsburgh, PA. I went to college at Penn State where I majored in Professional Golf Management (I swear, this is a real major) and minored in business administration. My wife and I lived in Washington, DC before recently moving to Uganda for her work. When I'm not coding, I'm golfing, playing video games, or reading Sci-Fi/Fantasy.
